Mainly, feedforward neural networks aim at efficient building, training, and deployment of deep learning models using the Keras and TensorFlow libraries.

Feedforward neural networks are among the more basic models of deep learning. They concentrate most on the classification problems, regression, and function approximation.

Python Libraries Used:

TensorFlow: Developed by Google as an open-source library that is robust for high-performance computation in deep learning and for large-scale machine learning tasks.
This is known as Keras: a high-level API implemented on top of the base TensorFlow. That means it allows one to simplify the building of neural networks by providing intuitive, user-friendly functions to define, compile, and train models.

Advantages
1. It is easy to use-the API is very newbie-friendly, so model development can happen faster.
2. Flexibility-TensorFlow is very flexible, so many custom layers and operations are possible.
3. Scalability-TensorFlow can handle large datasets and run on GPUs, CPUs, or TPUs.

Disadvantages
1. It is very hard to understand for a newcomer. TensorFlow is difficult to understand at first. 2. Sometime, it's difficult to debug the errors in large projects in TensorFlow. 3. Resource-intensive: Running deep learning models can be quite computationally expensive.
