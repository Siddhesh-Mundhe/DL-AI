Design family relationships as a tree so that the relationships can be represented efficiently especially during the query 
for relations like ancestors and siblings and familial connections may even be visualized. It is capable of storing 
relationship data systematically and retrieving it easily.

Libraries Used
1. NetworkX: The library helps in working with tree structures so as to represent the family relationships.
2. Pandas: Helps to organize and manage family data, which are imported mostly from spreadsheets.
3. matplotlib/Graphviz: Packages that help in visualizing family trees.
4. xml.etree.ElementTree/json: Useful to parse family data from XML or JSON; they are usually good formats for records in genealogy.

Benefits of :
1. Complex relationships (such as cousins or extended family) can be reached faster.
2. The data is structured in a hierarchical manner, which simplifies the tracking of a lineage.
3. Family ties can be easily visualized .
4. It is useful for historical and genealogic research.

Limitations:
1. Handling non-traditional families (such as step-relations) can be difficult
2. It requires careful validation of data to assure of the accuracy of the relationships.
3. Large trees demand considerable resources for parsing.
4. Storing family data contains privacy and security considerations.
