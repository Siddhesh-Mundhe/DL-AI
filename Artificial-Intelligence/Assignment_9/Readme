A practical application in that regard could be a customer support or appointment scheduling bot.
A chatbot application would be designed with a specific design of an interactive, conversational agent that 
interprets the user queries and offers corresponding answers.

Customer Support
Offer 24/7 support through troubleshooting FAQs, routing to human agents where needed, Automation
To users: repetitive tasks of scheduling, booking, or releasing information.
Personalized User Experience: Thus, it accelerates the satisfaction of the user by giving rapid and accurate response in conversationally.

Libraries
NLTK or spaCy: It offers complete NLP functionalities like tokenization, entity recognition, and intent classification.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: These are needed to train machine learning models to enhance intent and response generation.
ChatterBot: This is used as a high-level library where the chatbot is constructed for predefined responses and conversational flow.
Flask/Django: It will be used for the development of web API, by which chat will be deployed as a web application
Twilio/Dialogflow/Microsoft Bot Framework: To deploy on multi-platform, e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger.

Benefits
Availability 24/7, which provides significant improvements in the accessibility of services and reduces the waiting period for a customer
Cost-Efficient: Since the bot can automate routine tasks, it reduces the cost of support to customers and minimizes human intervention
Scalability: Handling multiple users simultaneously, the more the number of its users, the more scalable it is.
Invariable Answers: Suggests standard answers, so the information provided is correct and less variable.

Drawbacks
Ease to Understand: Rarely does a chatbot understand complicated, ambiguous or abstruse questions and thus the interaction remains unsatisfactory.
Dependence on Training Data: If the data is of minor quality and quantity on which the model was trained it might not work well.
Cannot Understand: Sensitive situations require empathy, and chatbots never have any.
Maintenance: This entails periodic updates to ensure the responses are kept appropriate and as accurate as possible with the shifting user language patterns.
